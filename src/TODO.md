# TODO List:

A list so I don't forget what needs to be done:

- [ ] Unify the drawer for "Select Category" (from one for selecting and one for editing the categories)
- [ ] Unify the drawer for "Select Account" (from one for selecting and one for editing the categories)
- [ ] Implement editing categories in `profileSettings/EditCategories.tsx`
- [ ] Implement editing accounts in `profileSettings/EditAccounts.tsx`
- [ ] Make the account switcher work in `views/HomeView.tsx`  
- [ ] Implement skeleton loading states for the transaction list, categories and accounts
- [ ] Create favicon
- [ ] Fix dates close to midnight not beeing on the correct date (probably use `DateTimeOffset` on the backend??)
- [ ] Prevent deleting accounts / categories, that are linked in an transaction (as that is deleting the transactions as well!)

## PWA

- [ ] Figure out what needs to be done for this to be a PWA
